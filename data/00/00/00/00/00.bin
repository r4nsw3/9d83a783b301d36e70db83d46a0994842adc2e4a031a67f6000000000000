  |   Call of Cthulhu, the official videogame inspired by Chaosium's        |
  |   classic pen and paper RPG, brings you deep into a world of creeping   |
  |   madness and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft's iconic universe.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   1924. Private Investigator Pierce is sent to look into the tragic     |
  |   death of the Hawkins family on the isolated Darkwater Island. Soon    |
  |   enough, Pierce is pulled into a terrifying world of conspiracies,     |
  |   cultists, and cosmic horrors. Nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an    |
  |   irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by whisperings in the     |
  |   dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and sinister cults dominate   |
  |   the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring    |
  |   about the end of everything.                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Your mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses     |
  |   will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything        |
  |   around you. Trust no one. Slinking shadows hide lurking figures...    |
  |   and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.      |
  |                                                                         |
